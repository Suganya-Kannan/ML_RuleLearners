Identifying poisonous mushrooms with rule learners

As one of the strengths of rule-learning algorithms is the fact that they generate easy to understand rules, they seem like an appropriate fit for this classification task. However, the rules will only be as useful as they are accurate. Here, I've used      two rule learners, 1R and RIPPER, to develop rules for identifying poisonous mushrooms.

The 1R algorithm used a single feature to achieve 99 percent accuracy in identifying potentially-fatal mushroom samples. On the other hand, the set of nine rules generated by the more sophisticated RIPPER algorithm correctly identified the edibility of every mushroom.
